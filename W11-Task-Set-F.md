> **This is an extension of the app you already built in Week 11.** It is not a build from scratch, and it tests only this week's concepts. Bring your numbers written down.

## 1. Problem statement

The complaint is: "a lawyer said it cited the wrong clause on termination, maybe Thursday." No trace id, no contract id, no timestamp — that is everything you get, and it is everything you will ever get. Find it in your Week-11 logs on the clock, then close the loop so this exact failure can never ship again.


---

## 2. Requirements

1. A squadmate plants one bad clause-citation answer in your logs and describes it to you only as vaguely as above. Find it from logs alone and report time-to-find in mm:ss plus which slice found it (time / user / prompt version / input type / cost outlier). Under 5 minutes, or your write-up must name the exact log field whose absence cost you the time.
2. Paste the found trace: per-span latency, tokens and cost, plus prompt version and the retrieved context ids for that request.
3. Turn the failure into an eval case, run the suite, and show it RED before the fix and GREEN after — with the suite pass counts both times (e.g. 9/10 -> 11/11), so a silent regression elsewhere cannot hide.
4. Fix at the prompt or retrieval layer, record the prompt version bump, and write a two-line canary and rollback plan for shipping it.
5. Report cost per query for that request broken down by stage (retrieval / generation / tools), then answer in one line: at 10x today's query volume, what breaks first — cost, latency, or a rate limit — with the number that proves it.

## 3. Expected output

drill.md (time-to-find in mm:ss + slice used), trace.json, the new eval case file, suite output RED then GREEN with pass counts, cost_by_stage.md, tenx.md (one line + number).


---

## 4. Evaluation rubric

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| Loop closed: eval case seen RED before the fix and GREEN after, with suite pass counts both times | 30 |
| Time-to-find reported in mm:ss with the slice named, or the missing log field named honestly | 25 |
| Trace pasted with per-span latency, tokens, cost, prompt version and retrieved context ids | 20 |
| Cost per query broken down by stage and the 10x claim backed by a number | 15 |
| Prompt version bump recorded with a two-line canary and rollback plan | 10 |
| **Total** | **100** |

*Zero points for polish, UI, or "it works". This mirrors the House rubric: failure-finding and a number that moved are what score.*

## 5. Bonus challenge

Wire the drill shut: add the missing log field or index that would have made the find instant, have your squadmate plant a second bad answer, and beat your own time. Report both times and the one field that closed the gap.


---

## 6. Submission checklist

- [ ] drill.md — mm:ss, the slice that found it, timed by a named squadmate
- [ ] trace.json — per-span latency/tokens/cost + prompt version + context ids
- [ ] The eval case file, added to the Week-6 suite
- [ ] Suite output pasted twice: RED before, GREEN after, pass counts on both
- [ ] cost_by_stage.md — cost/query split by retrieval, generation, tools
- [ ] tenx.md — what breaks first at 10x, with the number


---

## 7. Common mistakes

- **Optimising before attributing cost by stage, so you cannot say what the saving came from — the number moved and you have no idea which change moved it.**
- **Fixing the prompt first and adding the eval case afterwards, so you never watched it fail — a test that has only ever been green is a test you have not tested.**
- **Searching only inputs when the complaint describes the output (the clause reference is in the answer, not the question), which is why both have to be indexed and why you burn four of your five minutes here.**
- **Adding the eval case, seeing it green, and not re-running the rest of the suite — your termination-clause fix quietly broke the governing-law case and you shipped both.**
- **Not logging the retrieved context ids, so you can see clause 12.4 cited but cannot tell whether retrieval served the superseded pre-amendment text or the model misread the right one — that is a two-day mystery instead of a one-hop diagnosis.**
- **Calling 4:59 a pass when you found it by recognising the MSA you were reviewing on Friday — that is memory, not tooling, and it will not be there when a colleague runs the drill at 3am.**

*Set F of 6. Sets A–F are equivalent in difficulty and objectives; only the domain differs.*
